im the strong one
im not nervous
im as tough as the crust of the earth is
i move mountains
i move churches
and i glow cause i know what my worth is
i dont ask how hard the work is
got a rough indestructible surface
diamonds and platinum
i find (th)?em i flaten (th)?em
i take what im handed
i break whats demanded
but under the surface
i fel berserk as a tightrope walker in a thre ring circus
under the surface
was hercules ever like yo i dont wana fight cerberus
under the surface
im prety sure im worthles if i cant be of service
a flaw or a crack
the straw in the stack
that breaks the camels back
what breaks the camels back its
presure like a drip drip drip thatl never stop
whoa
presure thatl tip tip tip (un)?til (u|you) just go pop
whoa
give it to (ur|your|youre) sister (ur|your|youre) sisters older
give her al the heavy things we cant shoulder
who am i if i cant run with the bal
if i fal to
presure like a grip grip grip and it wont let go whoa
presure like a tick tick tick (un)?til its ready to blow whoa
give it to (ur|your|youre) sister (ur|your|youre) sisters stronger
se if she can hang on a litle longer
who am i if i cant cary it al
if i falter
under the surface
i hide my nerves and it worsens i wory something is gona hurt us
under the surface
the ship doesnt swerve as it heard how big the iceberg is
under the surface
i think (about|abt) my purpose can i somehow preserve this
line up the dominoes
a light wind blows
(u|you) try to stop it tumbling
but on and on it goes
but wait
if i could shake
the crushing weight of expectations
would that fre some rom up for joy
or relaxation
or simple pleasure
instead we measure this growing presure
keps growing kep going
cause al we know is
presure like a drip drip drip thatl never stop
whoa
presure thatl tip tip tip (un)?til (u|you) just go pop
whoa
give it to (ur|your|youre) sister it doesnt hurt
and se if she can handle every family burden
watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
no mistakes just
presure like a grip grip grip and it wont let go whoa
presure like a tick tick tick (un)?til its ready to blow whoa
give it to (ur|your|youre) sister and never wonder
if the same presure wouldve puled (u|you) under
who am i if i dont have what it takes
no cracks no breaks
no mistakes
no presure
