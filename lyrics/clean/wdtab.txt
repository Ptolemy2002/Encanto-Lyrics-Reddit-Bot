married in a hurricane

grew to live in fear of bruno stuttering or stumbling
i could always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
i associate him with the sound of falling sand
ch ch ch
its a heavy lift with a gift so humbling
always left abuela and the family fumbling
grappling with prophecies they couldnt understand
do you understand
a seven foot frame
rats along his back
when he calls your name
it all fades to black
yeah he sees your dreams
and feasts on your screams
hey

he told me id grow a gut and just like he said
no no
he said that all my hair would disappear now look at my head
no no hey
your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read
he told me that the life of my dreams would be promised and someday be mine
he told me that my power would grow like the grapes that thrive on the vine
aye marianos on his way
he told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach
betrothed to another
