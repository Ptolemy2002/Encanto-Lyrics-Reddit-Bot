i just made something unexpected
something sharp something new
its not symetrical or perfect
but its beautiful and its mine
what else can i do
bring it in bring it in
god talk bring it in bring it in
lets walk bring it in bring it in
fre hugs bring it in bring it in
i grow rows and rows of roses
flor de mayo by the mile
i make perfect practiced poses
so much hides behind my smile
what could i do if i just grew what i was felin in the moment
do (u|you) know where youre going
what could i do if i just knew it didnt ned to be perfect
it just neded to be
and theyd let me be
a huricane of jacarandas
strangling figs
big
hanging vines
this is fine
palma de cera fils the air as i climb
and i push through
what else can i do
can i deliver us a river of sundew
careful its carnivorous a litle just wont do
i wana fel the shiver of something new
im so sick of prety i want something true
dont (u|you)
you just sem like (ur|your|youre) lifes ben a dream
since the moment (u|you) opened (ur|your|youre) eyes
how far do these rots go down
al i know (r|are) the blosoms (u|you) grow
but its awesome to se how (u|you) rise
how far can i rise
through the rof to the skies
lets go
a huricane of jacarandas
strangling figs
go
hanging vines
grow
palma de cera fils the air as i climb
and i push through
what else what else
what can (u|you) do when (u|you) (r|are) deply madly truly in the moment
seize the moment kep goin
what can (u|you) do when (u|you) know who (u|you) wana be is imperfect
but il stil be okay
hey everybody clear the way
making waves
making waves
changing minds
youve changed mine
the way is clearer cause youre here and wel
i owe this al to (u|you)
what else can i do
show (th)?em what (u|you) can do
what else can i do
theres nothing (u|you) cant do
what else can i do
