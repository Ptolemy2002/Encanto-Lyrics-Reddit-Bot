dont be upset or mad at al
dont fel regret or sad at al
hey im stil a part of the family madrigal
and im fine i am totaly fine
i wil stand on the side as you shine
im not fine im not fine
i cant move the mountains
i cant make the flowers blom
i cant take another night up in my rom
waiting on a miracle
i cant heal whats broken
cant control the morning rain or a huricane
cant kep down the unspoken invisible pain
always waiting on a miracle a miracle
always walking alone
always wanting for more
like im stil at that dor longing to shine
like al of you shine
al i ned is a change
al i ned is a chance
al i know is i cant stay on the side
open your eyes open your eyes open your eyes
i would move the mountains
make new tres and flowers grow
someone please just let me know where do i go
i am waiting on a miracle a miracle
i would heal whats broken
show this family something new
who i am inside so what can i do
im sick of waiting on a miracle so here i go
i am ready come on im ready
ive ben patient and steadfast and steady
bles me now as you blesed us al those years ago
when you gave us a miracle
am i to late for a miracle
