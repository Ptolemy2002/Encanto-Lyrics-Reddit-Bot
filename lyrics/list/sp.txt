1. I'm the strong one
2. I'm not nervous
3. I'm as tough as the crust of the earth is
4. I move mountains
5. I move churches
6. And I glow 'cause I know what my worth is
7. I don't ask how hard the work is
8. Got a rough indestructible surface
9. Diamonds and platinum
10. I find 'em, I flatten 'em
11. I take what I'm handed
12. I break what's demanded
13. But under the surface
14. I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
15. Under the surface
16. Was Hercules ever like "Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus"?
17. Under the surface
18. I'm pretty sure I'm worthless if I can't be of service
19. A flaw or a crack
20. The straw in the stack
21. That breaks the camel's back
22. What breaks the camel's back it's
23. Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop
24. whoa
25. Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'till you just go pop
26. whoa
27. Give it to your sister, your sister's older
28. Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
29. Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
30. If I fall to
31. Pressure like a grip, grip, grip and it won't let go, whoa
32. Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa
33. Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
34. See if she can hang on a little longer
35. Who am I if I can't carry it all?
36. If I falter
37. Under the surface
38. I hide my nerves, and it worsens, I worry something is gonna hurt us
39. Under the surface
40. The ship doesn't swerve as it heard how big the iceberg is
41. Under the surface
42. I think about my purpose, can I somehow preserve this?
43. Line up the dominoes
44. A light wind blows
45. You try to stop it tumbling
46. But on and on it goes
47. But wait
48. If I could shake
49. the crushing weight of expectations
50. Would that free some room up for joy
51. Or relaxation
52. or simple pleasure?
53. Instead we measure this growing pressure
54. Keeps growing, keep going
55. 'Cause all we know is
56. Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop
57. whoa
58. Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop
59. whoa
60. Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt
61. And see if she can handle every family burden
62. Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
63. No mistakes just
64. Pressure like a grip, grip, grip and it won't let go, whoa
65. Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa
66. Give it to your sister and never wonder
67. If the same pressure would've pulled you under
68. Who am I if I don't have what it takes?
69. No cracks, no breaks
70. No mistakes
71. no pressure
