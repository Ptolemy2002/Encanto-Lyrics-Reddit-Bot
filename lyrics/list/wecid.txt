1. I just made something unexpected
2. Something sharp, something new
3. It's not symmetrical or perfect
4. But it's beautiful and it's mine
5. What else can I do?
6. Bring it in, bring it in
7. Good talk, bring it in, bring it in
8. Let's hug, bring it in, bring it in
9. Free hugs, bring it in, bring it in
10. I grow rows and rows of roses
11. Flor de mayo, by the mile
12. I make perfect, practiced poses
13. So much hides behind my smile
14. What could I do if I just grew what I was feelin' in the moment?
15. (Do you know where you're going?)
16. What could I do if I just knew it didn't need to be perfect?
17. It just needed to be?
18. And they'd let me be?
19. A hurricane of jacarandas
20. Strangling figs
21. ^(big)
22. hanging vines
23. (this is fine)
24. Palma de cera fills the air as I climb
25. And I push through
26. What else can I do?
27. Can I deliver us a river of sundew?
28. Careful, it's carnivorous, a little just won't do
29. I wanna feel the shiver of something new
30. I'm so sick of pretty, I want something true
31. don't you?
32. You just seem like your life's been a dream
33. Since the moment you opened your eyes
34. (How far do these roots go down?)
35. All I know are the blossoms you grow
36. But it's awesome to see how you rise
37. How far can I rise?
38. Through the roof, to the skies
39. Let's go
40. A hurricane of jacarandas
41. Strangling figs
42. ^(go)
43. hanging vines
44. ^(grow)
45. Palma de cera fills the air as I climb
46. And I push through
47. What else, what else?
48. What can you do when you are deeply, madly, truly in the moment?
49. (Seize the moment, keep goin')
50. What can you do when you know who you wanna be is imperfect?
51. But I'll still be okay
52. Hey, everybody clear the way
53. Making waves
54. (making waves)
55. changing minds
56. (you've changed mine)
57. The way is clearer 'cause you're here, and well
58. I owe this all to you
59. What else can I do?
60. (Show 'em what you can do)
61. What else can I do?
62. (There's nothing you can't do)
63. What else can I do?
