1. Don't be upset or mad at all
2. Don't feel regret or sad at all
3. Hey, I'm still a part of the family Madrigal
4. And I'm fine, I am totally fine
5. I will stand on the side as you shine
6. I'm not fine, I'm not fine
7. I can't move the mountains
8. I can't make the flowers bloom
9. I can't take another night up in my room
10. Waiting on a miracle
11. I can't heal what's broken
12. Can't control the morning rain or a hurricane
13. Can't keep down the unspoken invisible pain
14. Always waiting on a miracle, a miracle
15. Always walking alone
16. Always wanting for more
17. Like I'm still at that door longing to shine
18. Like all of you shine
19. All I need is a change
20. All I need is a chance
21. All I know is I can't stay on the side
22. Open your eyes
23. open your eyes
24. open your eyes
25. I would move the mountains
26. Make new trees and flowers grow
27. Someone please just let me know, where do I go?
28. I am waiting on a miracle
29. A miracle
30. I would heal what's broken
31. Show this family something new
32. Who I am inside, so what can I do?
33. I'm sick of waiting on a miracle, so here I go
34. I am ready, come on, I'm ready
35. I've been patient, and steadfast, and steady
36. Bless me now as you blessed us all those years ago
37. When you gave us a miracle
38. Am I too late for a miracle?
